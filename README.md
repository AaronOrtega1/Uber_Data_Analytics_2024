## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AaronOrtega1/SQL-PowerBI-Project.git
cd SQL-PowerBI-Project
```

2. **Create a .env file in the root of the folder with the next information**
```env
POSTGRES_DB=uber_db
POSTGRES_USER=uber_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=uber_passwordd
```

3. **Start PostgreSQL with Docker**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. **The `docker-compose.yml` file automatically creates the Database.**
4. **Then a Python script runs that preprocess the data and loads it into a staging bookings table.**
5. **Then the Python script uses the data loaded into the staging table to create a star schema to have simpler queries and simplified Business Reporting logic.**
5. **To create a dashboard of your own, you have to connect the PostgreSQL DB to Power BI desktop also using the information in the `docker-compose.yml` file.**
